//Notes on Threads :
//In most current operating systems, an executed programâ€™s code is run in a process,
//and the operating system manages multiple processes at once. Within your program,
//you can also have independent parts that run simultaneously.
//The features that run these independent parts are called threads.

//Programming languages implement threads in a few different ways.
//Many operating systems provide an API for creating new threads.
//This model where a language calls the operating system APIs to create threads is sometimes
// called 1:1, meaning one operating system thread per one language thread.

//Many programming languages provide their own special implementation of threads.
//Programming language-provided threads are known as green threads,
//and languages that use these green threads will execute them in the context of a different
//number of operating system threads.
//For this reason, the green-threaded model is called the M:N model:
//there are M green threads per N operating system threads,
//where M and N are not necessarily the same number.

//The Rust standard library only provides an implementation of 1:1 threading.
