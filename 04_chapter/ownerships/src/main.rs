//Ownership Rules...
// 1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
// 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

//The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time:
//  assigning a value to another variable moves it.
//When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope,
//  the value will be cleaned up by "drop"
//  unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable.
